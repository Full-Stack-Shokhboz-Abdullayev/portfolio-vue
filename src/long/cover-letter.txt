I'm Shokhboz Abdullaev, a Junior Frontend Developer. I have been looking for a Junior Frontend Developer position. I have been learning and making some cool projects for the web for about a year. And I'm also excited about finding and applying for UROS tech company. If said the truth, I have an experience with HTML, CSS, Sass(Scss), JavaScript. I started developing Single Page Applications with JavaScript's framework - Vue.js 4 months ago and learnt a lot about Vue, Vuex, Vue-Router and Vue Plugins. You can check out my Project Portfolio built using Vue.js which is SPA (shox-pro.com). You can also find out more about my skills in my resume. I'm curious about having an initial call so please inform me when we'll get in touch.
